_0.pdb: this is the designed structure
_0.trb: this is a python dictionary file containing various meta data such as the GPU used, run time, etc... You can ignore this
traj/*.pdb: these are trajectory files you can use to visualize your folding trajectories. You probably want to turn these off during production as they can be quite large for big runs.

Open _0 in a molecular viewer. What do you notice about the structure? How does the structure you generated compared to the one in this example?
What do you notice about the sequence of the structure?
