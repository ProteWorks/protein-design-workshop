Open this structure in a molecular viewer and color by B factor

Compare this structure to ../../extras/9YHC.pdb by aligning them in a molecular viewer.
What is the RMSD? 

Do the regions with high pLDDT correspond with the regions that align well to 9YHC?

How does this structure compare to the one generated without including the MSA in step 1?
