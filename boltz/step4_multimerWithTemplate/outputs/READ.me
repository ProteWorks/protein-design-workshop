Open boltz-input_model_0.cif in a viewer and color by bfactor.

Compare this structure to ../../extras/9HUB.pdb. Is the antibody binding accurate?

Look at the metrics in confidence_boltz-input_model_0.json. Is the model confident in its prediction?

How do these metrics compare to the ones when no template was included?
