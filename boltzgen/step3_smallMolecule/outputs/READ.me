Open final_ranked_designs/final_designs_metrics1.csv in a spreadsheet editor.
Does the structure have good predicted binding affinity?
0.5 > is considered good.
0.75 > is considered strong.

Open intermediate_designs_inverse_folded/rucaparib.cif and final_ranked_designs/final_1_designs/rank1_recuparib.cif in a molecular viewer and align them.
Do they share the same binding mode? 
Show the final design in sticks. Are the interactions between the protein and small molecule reasonable? Are there hydrogen bonds being formed?
